# 3ds-homebrew-files

I make different branches. Each branch consists of different modding files. So make sure you grab the right branch. And if it is a seedminer method, there is no file that has been through seedminer, you have to add it yourself. Also pay attention to the branch name, I will put old or new in it, only you have to be careful (again) that you do not take new if you have old. Last but not least I don't do dsiware files, because that is a lot of work and I don't feel like it and I did mk7 old.
